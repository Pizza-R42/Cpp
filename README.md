# C++ Projects
## These Projects include some personal projects along with labs and assignments from university courses.

### [Assignment-3](Assignment-3)
- Tracks employee income over time utilizing user input and calculations.

### [Assignment-6](Assignment-6)
- A program reads and writes to CSV file datasets. Takes the data and writes it to an array of objects, sorts the array, and then writes the sorted array to a new CSV file.

### [Assignment-11](Assignment-11)
- Uses inheritance and abstraction to store different class types in a single array and call the different funcitons of each class.

### [Assignment-12](Assignment-12)
- A program using multiple inheritance to store different classes of people like students and teachers in a single array.

### [Bank](Bank)
- A program which simulates a banking system which a user can withdraw money, deposit money, and see account details. 
-	The bank stores a database of different users and their data. The user data is stored in an external file which is used by the program.
-	The user enters their name and password to find their information. 
-	When an admin is logged in, they can view the banks total value and users.
-	Register new users and check for duplicate accounts.

### [Casino](Casino)
- A program where multiple users at a time can play and bet on blackjack, roulette or slots in the terminal.
- Players can bet money on games until they run out.
- Players can withdraw money from an atm built using the Bank project
  
### [Connect-4](Connect-4)
- A terminal version of the game connect-4.

### [Lab-3](Lab-3)
- A program that uses classes and loops to store information about different movies.

### [Lab-4](Lab-4)
- A program created to sort and search through objects in an array.

### [Lab-5](Lab-5)
- A program that can read or write information of player highscores to a CSV file database.

### [Lab-6](Lab-6)
- A program that stores info of different types of technological items using objects and object inheritance.

### [Lab-7](Lab-7)
- A program that uses container classes from the STL library to store and manage data from an ecternal file.

### [PA1](PA1)
- This program implements a stack and queue class along with selection and insertion sorting.

### [PA2](PA2)
- This program implements a linked list, dynamyic array, and a stack and queue, along with a binary search.

### [PA3](PA3)
- This program uses recursion to implement mergesort and binary search methods.

### [PA4](PA4)
- This program implements hashing and binary search tree "BST" functions.

### [PA5](PA)
- This program implements tree traversals, sets and maps, topological sorting, BFS and Trie methods.
